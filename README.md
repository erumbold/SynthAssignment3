1. **Wendy Carlos:** I'm always impressed with the versatility of early synthesizers. Although they seem complex visually, there aren't actually that many components neede to create a variety of sounds. In Wendy's demonstration, she only used an oscillator, filter, and a couple envelope generators to create sounds that were quite different from each other, like trumpets and plucked strings. At 5:13-5:50, she's setting the vibrato to replicate a violin. Even as a violinist myself, I hadn't considered that vibrato wouldn't start immediately at the note onset, or that the vibrato should speed up as it goes. This only required a couple oscillators to accomplish, but also a high level of knowledge in the finer details of different instrument's sounds.

2. **Randy Jones:** I appreciated the discussion at 21:30 about the design of their software synthesizer. Not only does it make the software more accessible, it also reduces the level of perceived difficulty. Whether analog or software, having knobs that all look the same and cables hanging everywhere makes it incredibly difficult for a newcomer to figure out what's going on. Like the synthesizer in Wendy Carlos' demonstration, it seems more complex that it actually is. But in reality, it's just a few components that have the capability to create a wide variety of sounds.
