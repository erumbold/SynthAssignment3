## Basics
1. **Wendy Carlos:** I'm always impressed with the versatility of early synthesizers. Although they seem complex visually, there aren't actually that many components neede to create a variety of sounds. In Wendy's demonstration, she only used an oscillator, filter, and a couple envelope generators to create sounds that were quite different from each other, like trumpets and plucked strings. At 5:13-5:50, she's setting the vibrato to replicate a violin. Even as a violinist myself, I hadn't considered that vibrato wouldn't start immediately at the note onset, or that the vibrato should speed up as it goes. This only required a couple oscillators to accomplish, but also a high level of knowledge in the finer details of different instrument's sounds.
